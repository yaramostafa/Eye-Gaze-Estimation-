# Overview
This project is aimed at creating a Driver Monitoring System (DMS) capable of detecting faces of drivers and determining their gaze direction to enhance safety while driving.
It utilizes YOLOv8 for face detection and either ResNet50 or MobileNet for eye gaze detection.

## Features
- Face detection using YOLOv8
- Eye gaze detection using ResNet50 or MobileNet
- Real-time monitoring of driver's face and eye movements
